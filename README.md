Technique for detecting walking in place with multiple Wii balance Board

This repositories contains a VC2010 project with the technique that I develop to detect orientation and speed, of a person, on top of a set of balance boards. Up to four balances can be connectec right now.
This technique is in the walking in place field of research of humam machine interaction.

This repo may contains some proprietary code, and contains code from WiiYourself 1.15.

This project generates a DLL to be utilized bu your application.
There is also a example of usage of the DLL in Unity 3D

To start using, a set of procedures should be done in the begining of usage, to connect and calibrate the balances.
The DLL emmit status information through an internal text buffer, exposed to load application.

I am sharing this code, to make my project free to anyone interested in use it.
I set a MIT licence. However, it may contain some code from other lib.
At this moment, I believe that it need some companion DLL libraries not included.


Further updates will be provided to this project, as it is very messy now.
